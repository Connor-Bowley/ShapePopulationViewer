ShapePopulationViewer
=====================

## What is it?

ShapePopulationViewer is a software that allows you to dynamically interact with
multiple  surfaces at the same time. It is very useful for visualisation and
comparison of 3D surfaces by also displaying their scalars or vectors attributes
stored in the points, and allowing the user to simply modify the colormap.

ShapePopulationViewer is available as a [3D Slicer](http://www.slicer.org) extension.

## Build instructions

The extension can be built as a standalone project or as a 3D Slicer extension.

### Standalone build

Configure the project using CMake and build it.

### 3D Slicer extension build

Configure and build the extension following the generic instructions available
on the [3D Slicer Developer FAQ](https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Developers/FAQ/Extensions#How_to_build_an_extension_.3F).
